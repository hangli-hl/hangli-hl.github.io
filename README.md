# Hang Li's Homepage

I am head of Research at Bytedance Technology. I joined Bytedance in Beijing in 2017.  I worked at the Research Laboratories of NEC Corporation during 1990 and 2001, and Microsoft Research Asia during 2001 and 2012, Naoh's Ark Lab of Huawei Technologies during 2012 and 2017.

I obtained a B.S. in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from Kyoto University in 1988 and a M.S. in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from Kyoto University in 1990. I earned my Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Tokyo in 1998.

I am an ACM Fellow, ACL Fellow, and IEEE Fellow. My research areas include natural language processing, information retrieval, machine learning, and data mining.
